# Welcome

As an analyst in the banking industry, I use data to deliver actionable insights to better help customers and executives. I am excited to be at the forefront analyzing large amounts of data that will have real world results. 

In my current role, I primarily use Microsoft Excel and Tableau but have also learned other skills through self-teaching and academic coursework including Microsoft Power BI, R, SAS, Google Sheets, and am familiar with Python, HTML, and CSS. 


## What I’m Learning Now 

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Data Structures & Algorithms)



## My Goals 
Build projects and develop my portfolio, learn new skills, and work towards becoming a Data Scientist.
